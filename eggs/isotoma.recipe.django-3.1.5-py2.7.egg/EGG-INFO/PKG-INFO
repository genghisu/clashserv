Description: =====================
        isotoma.recipe.django
        =====================
        
        isotoma.recipe.django can be used to install Django. It's a whole lot like
        djangorecipe except that Django is treated like a proper egg.
        
        This recipe will make three scripts available in your bin/ directory (assuming
        the control-script option is not set):
        
        bin/django
            This script works in exactly the same way as the manage.py script found in
            any typical django project; for example, you can run "bin/django syncdb".
        
        bin/django-admin
            This script is the equivalent of the project-independent django-admin script
            available when django is installed using apt or easy_install.
        
        bin/django.wsgi
            An optional script, created if the wsgi option is set to "true". This script
            is designed to be called by a web server.
        
        The entire recipe assumes that your project is an egg and any apps contained
        within your project *do not* need to be on sys.path and hence refer to each
        other as::
        
            from yourproject.yourapp import models
        
        Example
        =======
        
        ::
        
            [buildout]
            parts = django
            versions = versions
            eggs =
                foo
                django-treebeard
        
            [django]
            recipe = isotoma.recipe.django
            project = foo
            settings = production
            wsgi = true
            eggs = ${buildout:eggs}
            
            [versions]
            Django = 1.3.1
        
        Supported Options
        =================
        
        project
            The name of your django project, be it a develop egg or a regular one. Note
            that isotoma.recipe.django will *not* create a project for you if it does
            not exist.
        
        settings
            The name of the settings file `within your project` to use, allowing you to
            create a settings.py containing development settings, and a production.py
            importing the development settings and overriding them where necessary.
            That way you just need to change this value from "settings" to "production".
            Defaults to "settings".
        
        extra-paths
            Any extra paths to add to sys.path that should be made available to your
            project egg / develop-egg.
        
        wsgi
            Defaults to false. If 'true', create a bin/django.wsgi script that can be
            added to a webserver configuration (using isotoma.recipe.apache for
            example - see below).
        
        bin-on-path
            This feature appends the buildout bin/ directory to os.environ['PATH'] so
            that your django project will have access to the buildout executables.
            For example, this might be useful if you install sphinx in your buildout
            build and want access to the sphinx executables from within django (as is
            the case in the readthedocs.org project).
        
        environment.foo
            e.g::
            
                environment.celery = "django"
        
            Used to make more environment variables available to your django project.
            Any value can be added after the "environment.". The example above adds::
            
                os.environ["celery"] = "django"
        
            to the django management scripts.
        
        control-script
            The name of the main management script. Defaults to "django" so if your
            buildout:bin-directory = "bin" (as is the default), your management script
            will be located at "bin/django", and your wsgi script at "bin/django.wsgi".
        
        eggs
            The eggs that you'd like to make available to your django project.
        
        extra-settings
            Provide a set of extra settings to override the django settings in your
            project, e.g.::
        
                extra-settings =
                    DATABASES['default']['USER'] = 'username'
                    DATABASES['default']['PASSWORD'] = 'password'
        
            A settings file made up of your project settings and the extra settings is
            then compiled in parts, added to the sys.path, then set as the django
            settings environment variable in the generated control script in your
            bin-directory.

        Example with isotoma.recipe.apache
        ==================================
        
        This example shows how isotoma.recipe.django and isotoma.recipe.apache can be
        combined to create the wsgi script and an apache configuration that can run
        that script. The generated apache config simply needs to be symlinked into
        /etc/apache2/sites-available and you're away.

        Changes
        =======
        
        3.1.5 (2011-12-08)
        ------------------
        
        - Added an extra-settings option to inject settings lines from our buildout
          configuration.
        
        
        3.1.4 (2011-10-25)
        ------------------
        
        - Fix bug preventing update of django script working-set.
        
        
        3.1.3 (2011-10-13)
        ------------------
        
        - Documentation release - fleshed out the README documentation.
        
        
        3.1.2 (2011-10-06)
        ------------------
        
        - Buildout now cleans up the django script where necessary.
        - The recipe no longer depends upon Jinja2.
        - Added a buildout configuration and empty project to the recipe as quick dirty
          recipe test.
        - Environment variables can now be added to the bin/django(.*) scripts allowing,
          for example, the addition of os.environ['CELERY_LOADER'] = 'django'.
        
        
        3.1.1 (2011-09-18)
        ------------------
        
        - Capitalise Jinja2 properly in dependencies so that it can be pinned properly
        - Added new option: "bin-on-path" which, if true, will add the buildout
          bin-directory to os.environ['PATH'] in each django script.
        
        
        3.1.0 (2011-09-14)
        ------------------
        
        - Eggs were never being installed due to a bug that used the working set in
          offline mode. Now we inherit from zc.recipe.egg.Egg which gives us a standard
          working_set method for correctly determining working_set.
        
        
        3.0.3 (2011-09-14)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed extra-paths bug where a blank extra-paths option would add the cwd.
        - Made the recipe PEP-8 compatible.
        
        
        3.0.2 (2011-06-30)
        ------------------
        
        - Adds apps to installed apps in the settings
        - Creates a test runner that can run the created apps
        - Creates an initial setup.py for the app
        - Creates a urls.py with sensible defaults, including serving static files in debug mode
        - Creates a settings.py and production.py heirachy, to enable settings overriding
        - Can download django from a specific URL
        - Added extra-paths option to append paths to sys.path in the bin/django* scripts.
        
        2.0.0
        -----
        
        - Ground up rewrite, to use the django egg, rather than downloading a tarball.
          This has removed the ability to use the SVN trunk
        
        1.2.3
        -----
        
        - Added the server_email buildout setting.
          Will set SERVER_EMAIL in the settings.py, so email can be correctly sent out from the server
        
        1.2.2
        -----
        
        - Added the creation of staging.py for staging environment deployments
        - The project path is now correctly added to the buildout
        
        1.2.1
        -----
        
        - Documentation updated
        
        1.0
        ---
        
        - Forked from djangorecipe and renamed to isotoma.recipe.django.
        
        0.20
        ----
        
        - The recipe know makes the `django` package know to setuptools during install.
          This closes #397864. Thanks to Daniel Bruce and Dan Fairs for the patch.
        
        - Fixed #451065 which fixes a problem with the WSGI log file option.
        
        - Added the posibilty to configure more FCGI related settings. Thanks to Vasily
          Sulatskov for the patch.
        
        0.19.2
        ------
        
        - The generated WSGI & FCGI scripts are now properly removed when
          options change (fixes #328182). Thanks to Horst Gutmann for the
          patch.
        
        - Scripts are now updated when dependencies change. This fixes #44658,
          thanks to Paul Carduner for the patch.
        
        0.19.1
        ------
        
        - Applied fix for the change in WSGI script generation. The previous
          release did not work properly.
        
        0.19
        ----
        
        - When running again with non-newest set the recipe will no longer
          update the Subversion checkout. Thanks to vinilios for the patch.
        
        - The WSGI and FCGI scripts are now generated using Buildout's own
          system. This makes them more similar to the generated manage script
          with regard to the setup of paths. Thanks to Jannis Leidel for the
          patch.
        
        0.18
        ----
        
        - Paths from eggs and extra-paths now get precedence over the default
          system path (fixes #370420). Thanks to Horst Gutmann for the patch.
        
        - The generated WSGI script now uses the `python` option if
          present. This fixes #361695.
        
        0.17.4
        ------
        
        - Fixed a problem when not running in verbose mode (fixes #375151).
        
        0.17.3
        ------
        
        - Removed dependency on setuptools_bzr since it does not seem to work
          like I expected.
        
        0.17.2
        ------
        
        - Changed the download code to use urllib2. This should make it work
          from behind proxies (fixes #362822). Thanks to pauld for the patch.
        
        0.17.1
        ------
        
        - Fixed a problem with the new WSGI logging option #348797. Thanks to
          Bertrand Mathieu for the patch.
        
        - Disable generation of the WSGI log if "wsgilog" isn't set, thanks to
          Jacob Kaplan-Moss for the patch.
        
        - Updated buildout.cfg and .bzrignore, thanks Jacob Kaplan-Moss.
        
        0.17
        ----
        
        - Added an option to specify a log file for output redirection from
          the WSGI script. Thanks to Guido Wesdorp for the patch.
        
        0.16
        ----
        
        - Subversion aliases are now supported (something like
          svn+mystuff://myjunk). Thanks to Remco for the patch.
        
        0.15.2
        ------
        
        - Update to move pth-files finder from the __init__ method to the
          install method so it runs in buildout-order, else it looks for pth
          files in dirs that may not yet exist. Thanks to Chris Shenton for
          the update to his original patch.
        
        0.15.1
        ------
        
        - Update to make the previously added pth-files option better
          documented.
        
        0.15
        ----
        
        - Added "pth-files" option to add libraries to extra-paths from
          site .pth files. Thanks to Chris Shenton for the patch.
        
        0.14
        ----
        
        - The recipe now supports creating a FCGI script. Thanks to Jannis
          Leidel for the patch.
        
        - When downloading a Django recipe for the first time the recipe now
          properly reports the url it is downloading from.
        
        0.13
        ----
        
        - Specifying a user name within a subversion url now works. The code
          that determined the revision has been updated. This fixes issue
          #274004. Thanks to Remco for the patch.
        
        - Updated the template for creating new projects. It now uses the
          current admin system when generating it's `urls.py` file. This fixes
          issue #276255. Thanks to Roland for the patch.
        
        0.12.1
        ------
        
        - Re-upload since CHANGES.txt was missing from the release
        
        0.12
        ----
        
        - The recipe no longer executes subversion to determine whether the
          versions is to be downloaded using subversion. This fixes issue
          #271145. Thanks to Kapil Thangavelu for the patch.
        
        - Changed the `pythonpath` option to `extra-paths`. This makes the
          recipe more consistent with other recipes (see issue #270908).
        
        0.11
        ----
        
        - Another go at fixing the updating problem (#250811) by making sure
          the update method is always called. It would not be called in the
          previous version since the recipe wrote a random secret (if it
          wasn't specified) to the options for use with a template. Buildout
          saw this as a change in options and therefore always decided to
          un-install & install.
        
        - When both projectegg and wsgi=True are specified, the generated wsgi
          file did not have the correct settings file in it. This has been
          fixed with a patch from Dan Fairs.
        
        - The recipe now has logging. All print statements have been replaced
          and a few extra logging calls have been added. This makes the recipe
          more informative about long running tasks. Thanks erny for the patch
          from issue #260628.
        
        0.10
        ----
        
        - The recipe no longer expects the top level directory name in a
          release tarball to be consistent with the version number. This fixes
          issue #260097. Thanks to erny for reporting this issue and
          suggesting a solution.
        
        - Revision pinns for the svn checkout now stay pinned when re-running
          the buildout. This fixes issue #250811. Thanks to Remco for
          reporting this.
        
        - Added an option to specify an egg to use as the project. This
          disables the code which creates the basic project structure. Thanks
          to Dan Fairs for the patch from issue #252647.
        
        0.9.1
        -----
        
        - Fixed the previous release which was broken due to a missing
          manifest file
        
        0.9
        ---
        
        - The settings option is fixed so that it supports arbitrary depth
          settings paths (example; `conf.customer.development`).
        
        - The version argument now excepts a full svn url as well. You can use
          this to get a branch or fix any url to a specific revision with the
          standard svn @ syntax
        
        - The wsgi script is no longer made executable and readable only by
          the user who ran buildout. This avoids problems with deployment.
